Often when I have been pairing with experienced back-end developers I notice them moving effortlessly into a text editor from the bash console. This was done on any environment, without the need to configure an editor. So I was keen to learn more of how to use VIM.

The following commands are some of the basics. For my use I probably don't need any much more than openning files, editing and saving. First, a few bash commands are helpfull to make the most of VIM.
#### Create a new file
```
touch myFile.html
```
