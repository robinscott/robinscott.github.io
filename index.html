            <p class="Ideation-text">An approach I introduced in my current role is to lead design idea sessions at the beginning of new projects. These idea sessions involve the development team and as many project stakeholders as possible.</p>
            <p class="Ideation-text">The sessions use Gamestorming techniques to explore the teams ideas and capture them in sketch form. These sketches are then refined and prototypes built for user testing. These session have increased stakeholder engagement in the development process and provided a large range of ideas to take forward.</p>
